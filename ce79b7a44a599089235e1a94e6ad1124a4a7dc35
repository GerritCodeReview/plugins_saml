As explained in my previous comments, I would prefer to see this addressed upstream, and only put an intermediate fix in this repository untill the upstream fix is released and this plugin switched to the consume the new pac4j version.\n\nAlso it would be great to start writing tests for this plugin. Would this issue be  a candidate for it?\n\n[1] https://github.com/pac4j/pac4j/issues/1406",

Could you work on that?\n\nThere is definitely a need for tests. Not only in this plugin.\n\n@Vlad: Are you still interested in this change and would continue to work on it?",
